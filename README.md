# Restfull-APITesting-Collection
My first API Testing Project in POSTMAN / All operations have been carried out CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete )
## About the project 
The project was carried out with the help of those from https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com who also provided me with the necessary documentation for API testing.
## Create Environments 
We have achieved 3 environments to make our work easier. 

1. "env" - It was created to contain our endpoint https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com 
2. "token" - It was created to contain the authorization token 
3. "bookingid" - It was created to contain the ID of the desired book
